# JavaScript & jQuery
Introduction :
This book explains how JavaScript can be used
in browsers to make websites more interactive,
interesting, and user-friendly. You will also learn about
jQuery because it makes writing JavaScript a lot easier. 


# EXPRESSIONS :
An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking
there are two types of expressions :

1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A
VALUE TO A VARIABLE 
In order for a variable to be useful, it needs to be
given a value. As you have seen, this is done using
the assignment operator (the equals sign).

var color = 'beige'; 


2. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR
MORE VALUES TO RETURN A
SINGLE VALUE .
You can perform operations on any number of
individual values (see next page) to determine a
single value. For example:
var area = 3 * 2; 

# OPERATORS 
Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to
create a single value from one or more values. 
ARITHMETI C OPERATORS :
JavaScript contains the following mathematical
operators, which you can use with numbers.
You may remember some from math class. 


USING ARITHMETIC
OPERATORS
This example demonstrates how
mathematical operators are used
with numbers to calculate the
combined values of two costs.
The first couple of lines create
two variables: one to store the
subtotal of the order, the other
to hold the cost of shipping
the order; so the variables are
named accordingly: subtotal
and shipping.
On the third line, the total is
calculated by adding together
these two values.
This demonstrates how the
mathematical operators can
use variables that represent
numbers. (That is, the numbers
do not need to be written
explicitly into the code.)
The remaining six lines of code
write the results to the screen. 

# function 
WHAT IS A FUNCTION? 
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements)

we have a many yype of function :
1. A BASIC FUNCTION 
2. declaring function
3. calling a function
